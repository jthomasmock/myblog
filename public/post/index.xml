      <description>When you first started in R you likely were writing simple code to generate one outcome.
print(&amp;quot;Hello world!&amp;quot;)## [1] &amp;quot;Hello world!&amp;quot;5 * 6## [1] 30x &amp;lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)## [1] 1 2 3 4 5This is great, you are learning about strings, math, and vectors in R!
Then you get started with some basic analyses. You want to see if you can find the mean of some numbers.</description>

IntroductionAfter a great discussion started by Jesse Maegan (@kiersi) on Twitter, I decided to post a workthrough of some (fake) experimental treatment data. These data correspond to a new (fake) research drug called AD-x37, a theoretical drug that has been shown to have beneficial outcomes on cognitive decline in mouse models of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.</description>
