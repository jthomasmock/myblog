      <description>Executive Summary Tenure is the biggest driver of churn, where ~42% of customer churn occurs during the first 6 months and 71.1% occurs within the first 12 months. Interestingly, 99.5% of the customer churn in the first 6 months and 98.9% in the first 12 months are customers on a month-to-month contract. Month-to-month customers make up 55% of the customer base, so while eliminating this type of contract is ill-advised, moving customers from a month-to-month to a one or two year contract should lead to decreased customer churn.</description>
